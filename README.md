# Unmodeled-error-constraint-GF-and-GB-models

We are grateful to the reviewer who provides the constructive comments. 

We are releasing the software that implements the proposed method and are using a paper as a way of documenting the software. 

Part of the source codes of the unmodeled-error constraint GF and GB models has been released. We also plan to release more source codes in the GitHub in the future.
